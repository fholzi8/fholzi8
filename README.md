<h2>Hi there</h2>


Here you will found my outsource brain and collection of good scripts/explanation/projects whatever which I have used in the past and/or using it nowadays.

Due to the fact that I experienced that some projects were gone (but still valuable in my view) I grab it and publish it here.

And, all repository in my account are valid and valuable for me but mustn't for you. Please keep this in mind.

Due to the fact I am working since several years in network engineering my repositories are related mostly to this kind of stuff and if you are also into this stuff please take a look also to these accounts:
