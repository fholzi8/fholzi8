<h2>Hi there</h2>


Here you will found my outsource brain and collection of good scripts/explanation/projects whatever which I have used in the past and/or using it nowadays.

Due to the fact that I have experienced that some projects were gone (but still valuable in my view) I grab it and publish it here.

<h3>What you can find here</h3>
