<h2>Hi there</h2>

Here you will found my outsource brain and collection of good scripts/explanation/projects whatever which I have used in the past and/or using it nowadays.

Due to the fact that I have experienced that some projects were gone (but still valuable in my view) I grab it and publish it here.

<h3>What you can find here</h3> (outsorced brain stuff)

<h3>K8s, Containers or Serverless</h3>

Do you know the Cloud Native Compute Foundation? Not, ok then have a look at the CNCF landscape to see how many possibilities exists to operate an application infrastructure: <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/">CNCF Landscape</a>.

Don't get confused but if you deployed it somehow through this jungle then you can start with your business application and have you planned your IT infrastructure according to your application infrastructure. And, thats exactly is the story behind all the IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, ITaaS.

How can you build, operate, and easliy scale (up/down) your physical world of network, security, storage, compute combine it with the virtualized world of different kinds of hypervisor or container architecture (i.e. Podman instead of Docker). Then implement your infrastructure application (meaning to operate and building your infrastructure) such as controllers, service orchestrators and so on so that all dependencies for your business application are met.

But not only the requirements of your business application has to be counted in. Also, the whole cost of your business application is important and then the distribution of application (cloud) comes also into the game.

<h4>General Topics</h4>
And, all repository in my account are valuable for me but mustn't for you. Please keep this in mind.

Due to the fact I am working since several years in network engineering my repositories are related mostly to this kind of stuff and if you are also into this stuff please take a look also to these accounts:
